= Certificate

Add your own certificates here.

Use following file names:

* _ca.crt_ - CA certificate.
* _ldap.crt_ - OpenLDAP certificate, signed by CA.
* _ldap.key_ - OpenLDAP certificate key.

If present, these files are added to OpenLDAP demo container during build.

If certificate files are not present, then certificate is generated when starting container.
